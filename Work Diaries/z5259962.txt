Week 1

Groups formed. I was nominated scrum master so i created the Jira account and added all the other members. 
We decided on a time to have a meeting besides the tutorial as well as creating all the necessary group chats 
in teams and messenger. We read through all the projects one by one and came up a list of pros and cons of each one. 
After discussing it in depth we decided on Project 1 as it was something that we could accomplish. 

Week 2

A first draft of user stories were written by all members. We also decided on the sprints structure. 
The acceptance criteria for the user stories were also written up. During the lab we were able to 
discuss which user stories were missing or were able to be grouped together. During our Monday lab 
we also assigned tasks for all members for the Thursday meeting which consisted of dividing up work for 
the systems architecture and story boards. On Thursday we had a meeting which went over our storyboards 
and diagrams for the system architecture and discussed if anything could be improved/changed. We also 
decided to start on writing the report and divided up the work based on sections. I was assigned to write 
the descriptions on how some defined user stories provided novel functionality compared to existing systems. 
I inputting my user stories and acceptance criteria into the Jira backlog.

Week 3

For this week, we decided to switch our database to PostgreSQL rather than reading from a json file.
Since I had experience working with databases, I was assigned to construct the database and get it 
running for all members to access. I decided to host the database on AWS as they had a free tier option.
We were able to connect all the members to the database by the end of the week. I also added to the proposal
an ER diagram to model the database and provide a schema. On our Thursday meeting we wrapped up the
final touches for our proposal and started to get working on the coding side of things. We assigned
roles such as who is doing frontend/backend/database coding. We assigned individuals based on experience.

Week 4

The main goals for this week was to have a working demo by week 5. We prioritised the high priority
user stories and decided to take on 1/3 of the user stories. We mainly focused on the recipe explorer,
and leaving the recipe contributor for the later sprints. We had to divide up the work load in terms of
front end and backend. I was assigned the backend, and I wrote tests and coded up a few functions that 
I wrapped in Flask routes to send to the frontend. The backend functions that I worked on was the
recipe match, recipe search and ingredient category sorting. Since I finished my backend work quite quickly, I 
decided to help out with frontend work doing ingredient categories and sorting. We also decided to have 2 1 hour meetings
on Wednesday and Friday rather than have a 2 hour meeting on Thursday, which will give us more chances to
update all members on what we're working on, struggling with and plan to do next.

Week 5

For this week, we had our demo. All functionalities of sprint 1 were implemented to the minimal viable product and therefore we were quite satisfied with the progress. The only changes that were required was to make everything look nicer and more presentable. After the demo, we decided to do our Retrospective A while we were still on call in the lab and completed that in a shared document. We went through what we did well, what didn't go so well and things to try for the next sprint and allocated that to individuals. We also decided what user stories to do for the next sprint and decided on meeting times for the coming weeks to delegate tasks.
