Week 1

Groups formed. I was nominated scrum master so i created the Jira account and added all the other members. We decided on a time to have a meeting besides the tutorial as well as creating all the necessary group chats in teams and messenger. We read through all the projects one by one and came up a list of pros and cons of each one. After discussing it in depth we decided on Project 1 as it was something that we could accomplish.
